## High-level Summary
The graphic novel is conceptually designed to educate children aged 10 and up about the wonders of the cosmos, more specifically, the marvels of eclipses. This is achieved through a story with images (graphic novel) aimed at capturing their attention. This is our attempt at a solution to the challenge, which was to create a story, game, or graphic novel about eclipses. We chose the latter because it's more engaging when providing information about eclipses. This is important as it can inspire younger individuals to become interested in the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos, serving as a small gateway into this marvelous world.


## Project Details
It's a graphic novel that, upon starting, gives you a brief background of the story, introduces you to the antagonist, and finally leads you to a quiz with 7 questions about eclipses. It allows children to retry incorrect questions, ensuring they consider the options and ultimately learn through repetition. All of this is done with the hope that this small challenge will spark their interest in space, and thus decide to investigate more on their own.


To create this visual novel, we used a Python library, RenPy, specifically designed for making visual novels, and employed Gimp to integrate images into the project.

## Use of AI
Yes, we used chatgpt to ask question about the differents pages we could use to find images and to answer questions about the code we were making. We also used Artbreeder to make a collage to create our antagonist
